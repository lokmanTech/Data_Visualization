    "# Introduction to JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn the basics of JavaScript, like its primitives, how to control the flow of a program, what scope is and why it matters, and data structure that can  be used in programming. Then, practice your new skills in two exercises: by coding quiz questions that demonstrate important JavaScript concepts and making a set of tests written in JavaScripts pass. Finally, lean about the DOM, an essential part of building web pages.\n",
